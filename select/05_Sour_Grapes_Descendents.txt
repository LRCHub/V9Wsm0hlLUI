Hi, I... I was just noticing you across the room
That's a really nice, pretty dress
Well, I saw you smiling, geez
I've never seen you before and I was wondering, you know
If you, like, you know
Oh no, okay, well, nevermind, see you later

Hey you, new wave, come over here
You're the prettiest thing I've seen all year
Hey you, new wave, don't turn away
Close those pouty lips and listen to what I say

(Why) must you smoke that clove cigarette?
(Why) must you act like you've got a hole in you head?
Tell me, tell me (why) don't you split the squares and love me instead?

Well
After all

You're shiny and clean, I've seen you in my dreams
You're like a Rolls Royce I can't have
Your presence makes me scream

Sour grapes
You leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes
I don't need you anyways

Sour grapes
Feeding, feeding my rage
Sour grapes
Sour grapes
Sour grapes

Hey you, new wave
Well, I pity you
When you get old
What will you do?

What will you do when you turn 21?
You're cockteasing at the singles bar just for fun, yeah
Tell me, tell me, what will you do when you turn 31?
What will you do when you don't know how to love anyone? Oh no

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Huh

Well, I wanted her cherry
I got sour grape too
In a cute purple mini
You're just (sour grapes)

No, I refuse to climb the ladder for you (sour grapes)
No, I refuse to pant and paw for you (sour grapes)
I need love, don't need no beauty queen (sour grapes)
But still, when I look at you, I scream

Sour grapes
You leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes
I don't need you anyways

Sour grapes
Just go riding right by me on the crest of the new wave
Sour grapes
Feeding, feeding my rage
Sour grapes
