You say you hate all those kids now.
You can't relate to the things they say to you.
You feel you've grown far beyond them.
You don't remember when you were like them.

And now you've grown up, you hate them.
A bad case of sour grapes? who knows?
You better get used to this picture,
Cause there's way more kids waiting in the hall.

You don't remember the problems.
You just complain like your parents did at you.
You swore you'd never be like them,
But now that you've grown up you're ten times worse.

And now you've grown up, you hate them.
A bad case of sour grapes? who knows?
You better get used to this picture,
Cause there's way more kids waiting in the hall.
